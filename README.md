Project Documentation
**1. Intended Logic and Efficient Code Implementation**
The provided code is a basic implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game in Python. It demonstrates how to structure a game, handle user inputs, and check for winning conditions.

**2. Programming Fundamentals**
The code utilizes several fundamental programming constructs:

**Classes and Objects:** The TicTacToe class encapsulates all game-related functionalities.
**Control Flow:** It uses loops and conditionals to manage the game flow and check for win conditions.
**Functions:** Methods are defined within the class to modularize the game's logic.

**3. Project Logic Plan**
Below is the flowchart that represents the logic of the Tic Tac Toe game:

**4. Validation and Error Fixes**
4.1 Error-based Fixes
Ensured the clearoutput method clears the screen correctly.
Checked user input validity in player_input and player_choice methods.

**4.2 Manual Testing**
Manual testing was done by running the script and playing the game multiple times to check for bugs and validate the flow.
Used PEP8 validator for code style and adherence to Python standards.

**5. Code Separation**
**Application Code:** The entire TicTacToe class.
External Code: No external libraries or tutorials were used in this implementation.

**7. Implementation Efficiency**
The code efficiently handles game logic, user input, and board state checks.
The win conditions are checked using a simple and readable set of conditions.

**8. Documentation of Libraries and Rationa**le
8.1 Necessary Libraries
No external libraries are required for this basic implementation.
8.2 Project Outcomes
The game correctly initializes, processes user inputs, checks for win conditions, and offers replay functionality.
Screenshots demonstrate a successful run of the game (not included here but should be captured during manual testing).
8.3 Project Rationale
The project aims to provide a simple, interactive command-line Tic Tac Toe game. It is designed to be user-friendly and demonstrate basic programming constructs for educational purposes.

**Deploying to Heroku**
Install Heroku CLI: If you haven’t installed it yet, download and install the Heroku CLI.

Log in to Heroku:
```heroku login```

Create a Heroku App:

sh
Copy code
heroku create your-app-name
Initialize a Git Repository (if not already done):

sh
Copy code
git init
Add Files to Git:

sh
Copy code
git add .
Commit Your Changes:

sh
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Push to Heroku:

sh
Copy code
git push heroku master
Scale the Worker:

sh
Copy code
heroku ps:scale worker=1
Your Tic Tac Toe game is now deployed on Heroku. To view logs and ensure your application is running correctly, use the following command:

sh
Copy code
heroku logs --tail
This will show the output of your application, which should include the initial welcome message. Since this is a command-line application, it’s not ideally suited for Heroku's web-centric platform, but it demonstrates the deployment process. For a fully interactive application, consider developing a web interface using frameworks like Flask or Django.
